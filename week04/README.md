Project Environment : Conda

Have to install Miniconda or Anaconda
(I used Miniconda for this project)

All the package needed for environment is included in directory "env" <br>
You can follow the instructions in pdf file to set the environment for this project

After you set all the thing needed, then fill the TO DO part in "lane_detection.py"

Good Luck !
