Project Environment : Conda

Have to install Miniconda or Anaconda
(I used Miniconda for this project)

All the package needed for environment is included in directory "env"
You can follow the instructions in PPT to set the environment for this project

After you set all the thing needed, then fill the TO DO part in "lane_detection.py"

Good Luck !
